peer_testimonies:
  - He is deepening his skills and knowledge as a front end developer at an impressive rate and is outpacing some of his more seasoned colleagues.
  - He also stepped into unknown territory (time series) and spent extra time outside of the project learning about this type of predictive analytics...
  - Typically I'd expect to see a significant loss in efficiency and knowledge with a newly formed team, but that really hasn't felt like an issue due to Jack's skill as a developer.
