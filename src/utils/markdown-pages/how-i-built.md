### Team Comments

> "Keep your attention to detail and focus on quality. Keep testing ruthlessly, and learning all you can about how to automate your own testing efforts. I was very impressed with how you were able to pick things up quickly but also focus on refactoring as you learned about new and better ways of doing things in React."

> "I’ve been very impressed by Jack in the short time I’ve been working with him. He has demonstrated a high level of intellectual curiosity when working with me on two separate projects requiring accessible code implementation by researching the topic, asking thoughtful questions, and quickly learning how to implement accessible code. He is deepening his skills and knowledge as a front end developer at an impressive rate and is outpacing some of his more seasoned colleagues."

> "He also stepped into unknown territory (time series) and spent extra time outside of the project learning about this type of predictive analytics and running many iterations on his own time at home. I am very impressed with Jack's maturity and professionalism."

> "Typically I'd expect to see a significant loss in efficiency and knowledge with a newly formed team, but that really hasn't felt like an issue due to Jack's skill as a developer and his willingness to reach out to the original team for answers when needed. delivers high-quality work, communicates his tasks and progress clearly, and is comfortable collaborating with the CX team on design and accessibility issues."

> "While Jack had a lot to learn for the tech stack involved, he turned around fast, and picked up concepts very quickly. His communication was very good and he was responsive. I think we are in a good place for the [project], largely thanks to Jack stepping in to take on remaining work we had in a very aggressive timeline. Thank you for your work, Jack!"

> "When you manage the dev ops (bamboo builds), it allows the team to deliver faster and more consistently, and adds in-demand skills/experience to you resume."
